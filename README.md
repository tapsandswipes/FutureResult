# FutureResult

A tiny library with a very simple implementation of Futures. 

I made this library mainly for fun and to learn how Futures work, and I ended up using it for some of my projects.

You can see all the public API [here](https://tapsandswipes.github.io/FutureResult/documentation/futureresult/)

## WARNING
I will modify this package to suit my needs so I don't garantee it will be backward compatible in any way. 

Use this package at your own risk.
